# Filesystem Abstraction in Go

Yet another one, created because none of the bazillon existing VFS matched
the needs we have.

Cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3 are considered "keyvals", similar to
databases where changing a byte in a value requires rewriting the whole value.
The goal is to be able to offer middleware interfaces that expose such
backends as proper filesystems supporting partial writes.

# Focus

This implementation focuses on the following goals:

* Stay as close as possible to filesystem concepts
* Be as compatible as possible with Golang's interfaces
* Be as simple as possible to extend
* Allow working with limited key/value backends

# Features

* Filesystem Backends:
  * localfs filesystem
  * memfs
  * zipfs (read only)
* Keyval Backends:
  * memkv
* Frontends:
  * net/http.FileSystem
* Middleware:
  * vdirfs: provides directory indexation/listing for backends which do not have this feature (such as zipfs)

## Planned

* Support for a wide range of backends (AWS S3, etc)
* Support for frontends (fuse, http, etc)
* Middlewares (keyvalâ†’filesystem adapters, encryption, etc)
